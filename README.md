#### I want to give you a huge welcome to my first repository. ðŸ¥³

2020 has been an atypical year for everyone, the plans that I proposed with great conviction were destroyed by our new enemy, the covid-19.

Thats carried me to stake out the new course of my career, as an industrial engineer I was always so close to numbers and computer science, the latter interested me for a long time but I never had "time" to learn about this, the covid was the perfect excuse to start in this wonderful world. Thank you Covid for giving me the time I always needed.

Maybe no one will ever read this file, but if you are reading I can tell you, never stop learning. Knowledge, discipline and love are the tools to choose the future we want to live.
